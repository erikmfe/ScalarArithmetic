#ScalarArithmetic

### Why?
* Because I don't need explicit casts to ```Double``` if I am expecting a ```Double```.
* ```5 + 5.0 ``` should return a ```Double```
* Because Double is only a CGFloat on 64bit, so you can't do this on 32 bit:
```
let myHeight = 34.5
let myWidth = 100.23
let sizeOfWindow = CGSize(:width : myWidth, height:myHeight) 
````



### Overview

Adds math functions as properties and takes care of operators for interacting between different types of scalars.
This library makes it easier to compare to ```Int```, ```Float``` and ```CGFloat``` regardless of architecture.

``var myDouble = 2.0`` will give you a ```Double``` and you'd want to use that with other types. 

Since ```CGFloat``` is not a ```Double``` on 32bit, it becomes hard to use CGGeomtry and frameworks like CoreGraphics or SpriteKite. This library makes it a little easier and hopefully Apple takes care of it soon. 

Works on both Mac OS and iOS.

### Math Functions
```swift
protocol ScalarFunctions {
  var acos:Double  {get}
  var asin:Double  {get}
  var atan:Double  {get}
  func atan2(x:Double) -> Double
  var cos:Double   {get}
  var sin:Double   {get}
  var tan:Double   {get}
  var exp:Double   {get}
  var exp2:Double  {get}
  var log:Double   {get}
  var log10:Double {get}
  var log2:Double  {get}
  func pow(exponent:Double) -> Double
  var sqrt:Double  {get}
}

```
